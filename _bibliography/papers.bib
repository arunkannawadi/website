 abstract = {{We evaluate the consistency between lensing and clustering based on
measurements from Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey
combined with galaxy-galaxy lensing from Dark Energy Survey
(DES) Year 3, Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC)
Year 1, and Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS)-1000. We find good
agreement between these lensing data sets. We model the
observations using the DARK EMULATOR and fit the data at two
fixed cosmologies: Planck (S$_{8}$ = 0.83), and a Lensing
cosmology (S$_{8}$ = 0.76). For a joint analysis limited to
large scales, we find that both cosmologies provide an
acceptable fit to the data. Full utilization of the higher
signal-to-noise small-scale measurements is hindered by
uncertainty in the impact of baryon feedback and assembly bias,
which we account for with a reasoned theoretical error budget.
We incorporate a systematic inconsistency parameter for each
redshift bin, A, that decouples the lensing and clustering. With
a wide range of scales, we find different results for the
consistency between the two cosmologies. Limiting the analysis
to the bins for which the impact of the lens sample selection is
expected to be minimal, for the Lensing cosmology, the
measurements are consistent with A = 1; A = 0.91
{\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.04 (A = 0.97 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.06) using
DES+KiDS (HSC). For the Planck case, we find a discrepancy: A =
0.79 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.03 (A = 0.84 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.05)
using DES+KiDS (HSC). We demonstrate that a kinematic Sunyaev-
Zeldovich-based estimate for baryonic effects alleviates some of
the discrepancy in the Planck cosmology. This analysis
demonstrates the statistical power of small-scale measurements;
however, caution is still warranted given modelling
uncertainties and foreground sample selection effects.}},

 abstract = {{Cosmological weak lensing measurements rely on a precise measurement of
the shear two-point correlation function (2PCF) along with a
deep understanding of systematics that affect it. In this work,
we demonstrate a general framework for describing the impact of
PSF systematics on the cosmic shear 2PCF, and mitigating its
impact on cosmological analysis. Our framework can describe
leakage and modeling error from all spin-2 quantities
contributed by the PSF second and higher moments, rather than
just the second moments. We interpret null tests using the HSC
Year 3 (Y3) catalogs with this formalism, and find that leakage
from the spin-2 combination of PSF fourth moments is the leading
contributor to additive shear systematics, with total
contamination that is an order of magnitude higher than that
contributed by PSF second moments alone. We conducted a mock
cosmic shear analysis for HSC Y3, and find that, if uncorrected,
PSF systematics can bias the cosmological parameters $\Omega_m$
and $S_8$ by $\sim$0.3$\sigma$. The traditional second moment-
based model can only correct for a 0.1$\sigma$ bias, leaving the
contamination largely uncorrected. We conclude it is necessary
to model both PSF second and fourth moment contamination for HSC
Y3 cosmic shear analysis. We also reanalyze the HSC Y1 cosmic
shear analysis with our updated systematics model, and identify
a 0.07$\sigma$ bias on $\Omega_m$ when using the more restricted
second moment model from the original analysis. We demonstrate
how to self-consistently use the method in both real space and
Fourier space, assess shear systematics in tomographic bins, and
test for PSF model overfitting.}},

 abstract = {{Weak lensing is one of the most powerful probes for dark matter and dark
energy science, although it faces increasing challenges in
controlling systematic uncertainties as the statistical errors
become smaller. The Point Spread Function (PSF) needs to be
precisely modeled to avoid systematic error on the weak lensing
measurements. The weak lensing biases induced by errors in the
PSF model second moments, i.e. its size and shape, are well-
studied. However, Zhang et al. (2021) showed that errors in the
higher moments of the PSF may also be a significant source of
systematics for upcoming weak lensing surveys. Therefore, this
work comprehensively investigate the modeling quality of PSF
moments from the 3$^{rd}$ to 6$^{th}$ order, and propagate the
PSFEX higher moments modeling error in the HSC survey dataset to
the weak lensing shear-shear correlation functions and their
cosmological analyses. The overall multiplicative shear bias
associated with errors in PSF higher moments can cause a
\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde0.1{\ensuremath{\sigma}} shift
on the cosmological parameters for LSST Y10, while the
associated additive biases can induce 1{\ensuremath{\sigma}}
uncertainties in cosmology parameter inference for LSST Y10, if
not accounted. We compare the PSFEX model with PSF in Full FOV
(PIFF), and find similar performance in modeling the PSF higher
moments. We conclude that PSF higher moment errors of the future
PSF models should be reduced from those in current methods,
otherwise needed to be explicitly modeled in the weak lensing
analysis.}},

coaddition schemes and the point-spread function (PSF) of the
resulting coadded images. In particular, we investigate what
properties of the coaddition algorithm lead to the final coadded
image having a well-defined PSF. The key elements of this
discussion are as follows: 1. We provide an illustration of how
linear coaddition schemes can produce a coadd that lacks a well-
defined PSF even for relatively simple scenarios and choices of
weight functions. 2. We provide a more formal demonstration of
the fact that a linear coadd only has a well-defined PSF in the
case that either (a) each input image has the same PSF or (b)
the coadd is produced with weights that are independent of the
signal. 3. We discuss some reasons that two plausible nonlinear
coaddition algorithms (median and clipped-mean) fail to produce
a consistent PSF profile for stars. 4. We demonstrate that all
nonlinear coaddition procedures fail to produce a well-defined
PSF for extended objects. In the end, we conclude that, for any
purpose where a well-defined PSF is desired, one should use a
linear coaddition scheme with weights that do not correlate with
the signal and are approximately uniform across typical objects

more inclusive and equitable collaboration on LSST science. To
facilitate such opportunities, a community workshop entitled
``From Data to Software to Science with the Rubin Observatory
LSST'' was organized by the LSST Interdisciplinary Network for
Collaboration and Computing (LINCC) and partners, and held at
the Flatiron Institute in New York, March 28-30th 2022. The
workshop included over 50 in-person attendees invited from over
300 applications. It identified seven key software areas of
need: (i) scalable cross-matching and distributed joining of
catalogs, (ii) robust photometric redshift determination, (iii)
software for determination of selection functions, (iv)
frameworks for scalable time-series analyses, (v) services for
image access and reprocessing at scale, (vi) object image access
(cutouts) and analysis at scale, and (vii) scalable job
execution systems. This white paper summarizes the discussions
of this workshop. It considers the motivating science use cases,
identified cross-cutting algorithms, software, and services,
their high-level technical specifications, and the principles of
inclusive collaborations needed to develop them. We provide it
as a useful roadmap of needs, as well as to spur action and

single-detector to full-survey summary statistics. By measuring

algorithmic performance and conduct regression testing during
development, compare the performance of one algorithm against
another, and verify that the LSST data products will meet
performance requirements by comparing to specifications. We

calibration sample to more than twice its size, now consisting

significantly extending the fraction of KiDS galaxies we are

enhanced the calibration sample with precision photometric

spectroscopic coverage of the KiDS data. Finally we performed a
Complete Orthogonal Sets of E/B-Integrals (COSEBIs) cosmic shear

0.748$_{{\ensuremath{-}}0.025}$$^{+0.021}$, which is in good
agreement with previous KiDS studies and increases the tension
with measurements of the cosmic microwave background to
3.4{\ensuremath{\sigma}}. We repeated the redshift calibration
with different subsets of the full calibration sample and
obtained, in all cases, agreement within at most
0.5{\ensuremath{\sigma}} in S$_{8}$ compared to our fiducial

to calibrate an additional 6\% of the source galaxy sample. Even
though further systematic testing with simulated data is
necessary to quantify the impact of redshift outliers, precision
photometric redshifts can be beneficial at high redshifts and to

parameter degeneracies inherent to both probes. The joint

{\ensuremath{\Delta}}{\ensuremath{\Sigma}} using lens samples
from BOSS and six independent lensing surveys. We find good
agreement between empirically estimated and reported systematic
errors which agree to better than 2.3{\ensuremath{\sigma}} in
four lens bins and three radial ranges. For lenses with z$_{L}$
> 0.43 and considering statistical errors, we detect a
3-4{\ensuremath{\sigma}} correlation between lensing amplitude
and survey depth. This correlation could arise from the
increasing impact at higher redshift of unrecognized galaxy
blends on shear calibration and imperfections in photometric
redshift calibration. At z$_{L}$ > 0.54, amplitudes may
additionally correlate with foreground stellar density. The
amplitude of these trends is within survey-defined systematic
error budgets that are designed to include known shear and
redshift calibration uncertainty. Using a fully empirical and
conservative method, we do not find evidence for large unknown
systematics. Systematic errors greater than 15 per cent (25 per
cent) ruled out in three lens bins at 68 per cent (95 per cent)
confidence at z < 0.54. Differences with respect to predictions
based on clustering are observed to be at the 20-30 per cent
level. Our results therefore suggest that lensing systematics
alone are unlikely to fully explain the 'lensing is low' effect
at z < 0.54. This analysis demonstrates the power of cross-
survey comparisons and provides a promising path for identifying
and reducing systematics in future lensing analyses.}},

model into two theory regimes determined by the smooth
background (geometry) and the evolution of matter density
fluctuations (growth), each governed by an independent set of
{\ensuremath{\Lambda}}CDM cosmological parameters. This extended
model is constrained by a combination of weak gravitational
lensing measurements from the Kilo-Degree Survey, galaxy
clustering signatures extracted from Sloan Digital Sky Survey
campaigns and the Six-Degree Field Galaxy Survey, and the
angular baryon acoustic scale and the primordial scalar
fluctuation power spectrum measured in Planck cosmic microwave

individually and the combined probes, we find strong consistency
between the geometry and growth parameters, as well as with the
posterior of standard {\ensuremath{\Lambda}}CDM analysis. In the
non-split analysis, for which one single set of parameters was
used, tension in the amplitude of matter density fluctuations as
measured by the parameter S$_{8}$ persists at around
3{\ensuremath{\sigma}}, with a 1.5\% constraint of S$_{8}$ =
0.776$_{{\ensuremath{-}}0.008}$$^{+0.016}$ for the combined

alleviate them, which we link to the discrepancy between low and
high multipoles in Planck data. Our geometry versus growth

origin of the discrepancies lies in {\ensuremath{\Lambda}}CDM
structure growth or expansion history but holds promise as an
insightful test for forthcoming, more powerful data.}},

these allow us to estimate robust absolute magnitudes and

isolated galaxies, comparing the expected gravitational
acceleration given the baryonic matter (g$_{bar}$) with the
observed gravitational acceleration (g$_{obs}$), using weak
lensing measurements from the fourth data release of the Kilo-
Degree Survey (KiDS-1000). These measurements extend the radial
acceleration relation (RAR), traditionally measured using galaxy
rotation curves, by 2 decades in g$_{obs}$ into the low-
acceleration regime beyond the outskirts of the observable
galaxy. We compare our RAR measurements to the predictions of
two modified gravity (MG) theories: modified Newtonian dynamics
and Verlinde's emergent gravity (EG). We find that the measured
relation between g$_{obs}$ and g$_{bar}$ agrees well with the MG
predictions. In addition, we find a difference of at least
6{\ensuremath{\sigma}} between the RARs of early- and late-type
galaxies (split by S{\'e}rsic index and u {\ensuremath{-}} r
colour) with the same stellar mass. Current MG theories involve
a gravity modification that is independent of other galaxy
properties, which would be unable to explain this behaviour,
although the EG theory is still limited to spherically symmetric
static mass models. The difference might be explained if only
the early-type galaxies have significant (M$_{gas}$
{\ensuremath{\approx}} M$_{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$)
circumgalactic gaseous haloes. The observed behaviour is also
expected in {\ensuremath{\Lambda}}-cold dark matter
({\ensuremath{\Lambda}}CDM) models where the galaxy-to-halo mass
relation depends on the galaxy formation history. We find that
MICE, a {\ensuremath{\Lambda}}CDM simulation with hybrid halo
occupation distribution modelling and abundance matching,
reproduces the observed RAR but significantly differs from
BAHAMAS, a hydrodynamical cosmological galaxy formation
simulation. Our results are sensitive to the amount of
circumgalactic gas; current observational constraints indicate
that the resulting corrections are likely moderate. Measurements
of the lensing RAR with future cosmological surveys (such as
Euclid) will be able to further distinguish between MG and

(KiDS-1000), galaxy clustering from the Baryon Oscillation
Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS), and galaxy-galaxy lensing from the
overlap between KiDS-1000, BOSS, and the spectroscopic 2-degree
Field Lensing Survey, we find results that are fully consistent
with a flat {\ensuremath{\Lambda}}CDM model with
{\ensuremath{\Omega}}$_{K}$ =
0.011$_{{\ensuremath{-}}0.057}$$^{+0.054}$,
{\ensuremath{\sum}}m$_{{\ensuremath{\nu}}}$ < 1.76 eV (95\% CL),
and w = {\ensuremath{-}}0.99$_{{\ensuremath{-}}0.13}$$^{+0.11}$.
The f$_{R0}$ parameter is unconstrained in our fully non-linear
f(R) cosmic shear analysis. Considering three different model
selection criteria, we find no clear preference for either the
fiducial flat {\ensuremath{\Lambda}}CDM model or any of the
considered extensions. In addition to extensions to the flat
{\ensuremath{\Lambda}}CDM parameter space, we also explore
restrictions to common subsets of the flat
{\ensuremath{\Lambda}}CDM parameter space by fixing the
amplitude of the primordial power spectrum to the Planck best-
fit value, as well as adding external data from supernovae and
lensing of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Neither the
beyond-{\ensuremath{\Lambda}}CDM models nor the imposed
restrictions explored in this analysis are able to resolve the
{\ensuremath{\sim}}3{\ensuremath{\sigma}} tension in S$_{8}$
between the 3 {\texttimes} 2 pt constraints and the Planck
temperature and polarisation data, with the exception of wCDM,
where the S$_{8}$ tension is resolved. The tension in the wCDM
case persists, however, when considering the joint S$_{8}$
{\ensuremath{-}} w parameter space. The joint flat
{\ensuremath{\Lambda}}CDM CMB lensing and 3 {\texttimes} 2 pt
analysis is found to yield tight constraints on
{\ensuremath{\Omega}}$_{m}$ =
0.307$_{{\ensuremath{-}}0.013}$$^{+0.008}$,
{\ensuremath{\sigma}}$_{8}$ =
0.769$_{{\ensuremath{-}}0.010}$$^{+0.022}$, and S$_{8}$ =
0.779$_{{\ensuremath{-}}0.013}$$^{+0.013}$.}},

 abstract = {{We present a catalog of quasars with their corresponding redshifts
derived from the photometric Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS) Data
Release 4. We achieved it by training machine learning (ML)
models, using optical ugri and near-infrared ZYJHK$_{s}$ bands,
on objects known from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)
spectroscopy. We define inference subsets from the 45 million
objects of the KiDS photometric data limited to 9-band
detections, based on a feature space built from magnitudes and
their combinations. We show that projections of the high-
dimensional feature space on two dimensions can be successfully
used, instead of the standard color-color plots, to investigate
the photometric estimations, compare them with spectroscopic
data, and efficiently support the process of building a catalog.
The model selection and fine-tuning employs two subsets of
objects: those randomly selected and the faintest ones, which
allowed us to properly fit the bias versus variance trade-off.
We tested three ML models: random forest (RF), XGBoost (XGB),
and artificial neural network (ANN). We find that XGB is the
most robust and straightforward model for classification, while
ANN performs the best for combined classification and redshift.
The ANN inference results are tested using number counts, Gaia
parallaxes, and other quasar catalogs that are external to the
training set. Based on these tests, we derived the minimum
classification probability for quasar candidates which provides
the best purity versus completeness trade-off: p(QSO$_{cand}$) >
0.9 for r < 22 and p(QSO$_{cand}$) > 0.98 for 22 < r < 23.5. We
find 158 000 quasar candidates in the safe inference subset (r <
22) and an additional 185 000 candidates in the reliable
extrapolation regime (22 < r < 23.5). Test-data purity equals
97\% and completeness is 94\%; the latter drops by 3\% in the
extrapolation to data fainter by one magnitude than the training
set. The photometric redshifts were derived with ANN and modeled
with Gaussian uncertainties. The test-data redshift error (mean
and scatter) equals 0.009 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.12 in the safe
subset and {\ensuremath{-}}0.0004 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.19 in the
extrapolation, averaged over a redshift range of 0.14 < z < 3.63
(first and 99th percentiles). Our success of the extrapolation
challenges the way that models are optimized and applied at the
faint data end. The resulting catalog is ready for cosmology and
active galactic nucleus (AGN) studies.

that this approach is robust to the point-spread function in

distributions represent one of the crucial ingredients for weak
gravitational lensing measurements with the KiDS-1000 data. The
primary estimate is based on deep spectroscopic reference
catalogues that are re-weighted with the help of a self-
organising map (SOM) to closely resemble the KiDS-1000 sources,
split into five tomographic redshift bins in the photometric
redshift range 0.1 < z$_{B}$ {\ensuremath{\leq}} 1.2. Sources
are selected such that they only occupy that volume of nine-
dimensional magnitude-space that is also covered by the
reference samples (`gold' selection). Residual biases in the
mean redshifts determined from this calibration are estimated
from mock catalogues to be {\ensuremath{\lesssim}}0.01 for all
five bins with uncertainties of {\ensuremath{\sim}}0.01. This
primary SOM estimate of the KiDS-1000 redshift distributions is
complemented with an independent clustering redshift approach.
After validation of the clustering-z on the same mock catalogues
and a careful assessment of systematic errors, we find no
significant bias of the SOM redshift distributions with respect

re-calibrated by the clustering-z represent an alternative
calibration of the redshift distributions with only slightly
larger uncertainties in the mean redshifts of

correlations between BOSS and 2dFLenS galaxy positions and
source galaxy ellipticities have been incorporated into the
analysis, necessitating the development of a hybrid model of
non-linear scales that blends perturbative and non-perturbative
approaches, and an assessment of signal contributions by
astrophysical effects. All weak lensing signals were measured
consistently via Fourier-space statistics that are insensitive
to the survey mask and display low levels of mode mixing. The
calibration of photometric redshift distributions and
multiplicative gravitational shear bias has been updated, and a
more complete tally of residual calibration uncertainties was
propagated into the likelihood. A dedicated suite of more than
20 000 mocks was used to assess the performance of covariance
models and to quantify the impact of survey geometry and spatial
variations of survey depth on signals and their errors. The
sampling distributions for the likelihood and the
{\ensuremath{\chi}}$^{2}$ goodness-of-fit statistic have been
validated, with proposed changes for calculating the effective

mapped, and a more conservative, wide top-hat prior on the key

prevalent custom of reporting S$_{8}$ weak lensing constraints

highlighted to be easily misinterpreted as yielding
systematically low values of S$_{8}$, and an alternative
estimator and associated credible interval are proposed. Known
systematic effects pertaining to weak lensing modelling and
inference are shown to bias S$_{8}$ by no more than 0.1 standard
deviations, with the caveat that no conclusive validation data
exist for models of intrinsic galaxy alignments. Compared to the
previous KiDS analyses, S$_{8}$ constraints are expected to
improve by 20\% for weak lensing alone and by 29\% for the joint

In this paper, we study the impact of object detection for a
Euclid-like survey and show that it leads to biases that exceed
requirements for the next generation of cosmic shear surveys. In
realistic scenarios, the blending of galaxies is an important
source of detection bias. We find that METADETECTION is able to
account for blending, leading to average multiplicative biases
that meet requirements for Stage IV surveys, provided a
sufficiently accurate model for the point spread function is
available. Further work is needed to estimate the performance

inconclusive. Here we combine data from five weak lensing
surveys (NGVSLenS, KiDS/KV450, CFHTLenS, CS82, and RCSLenS,
listed in order of most to least constraining) in order to
tighten observational constraints on galaxy-scale halo
ellipticity for photometrically selected lens samples. We
constrain f$_{h}$, the average ratio between the aligned
component of the halo ellipticity and the ellipticity of the
light distribution, finding f$_{h}$ =
0.303$_{-0.079}$$^{+0.080}$ for red lens galaxies and f$_{h}$ =
0.217$_{-0.159}$$^{+0.160}$ for blue lens galaxies when assuming
elliptical Navarro-Frenk-White density profiles and a linear
scaling between halo ellipticity and galaxy ellipticity. Our
constraints for red galaxies constitute the currently most
significant (3.8{\ensuremath{\sigma}}) systematics-corrected
detection of the signature of halo flattening at the mass scale
of galaxies. Our results are in good agreement with expectations
from the Millennium Simulation that apply the same analysis
scheme and incorporate models for galaxy-halo misalignment.
Assuming these misalignment models and the analysis assumptions
stated above are correct, our measurements imply an average dark
matter halo ellipticity for the studied red galaxy samples of
⟨|ϵ$_{h}$|⟩ = 0.174 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.046, where |ϵ$_{h}$| =
(1 - q)/(1 + q) relates to the ratio q = b/a of the minor and
major axes of the projected mass distribution. Similar
measurements based on larger upcoming weak lensing data sets can
help to calibrate models for intrinsic galaxy alignments, which
constitute an important source of systematic uncertainty in
cosmological weak lensing studies.}},

excluding certain spectroscopic surveys during redshift

redshifts in redshift calibration; and (3) by considering only
those photometric sources which are jointly calibrated by at

utilised here has been proven to be robust: we find a maximal

 abstract = {{Context. Several semi-analytic models (SAMs) try to explain how galaxies
form, evolve, and interact inside the dark matter large-scale
structure. These SAMs can be tested by comparing their
predictions for galaxy-galaxy-galaxy lensing (G3L), which is
weak gravitational lensing around galaxy pairs, with
observations. \textbackslash Aims: We evaluate the SAMs by
Henriques et al. (2015, MNRAS, 451, 2663, hereafter H15) and by
Lagos et al. (2012, MNRAS, 426, 2142, hereafter L12), which were
implemented in the Millennium Run, by comparing their
predictions for G3L to observations at smaller scales than
previous studies and also for pairs of lens galaxies from
different populations. \textbackslash Methods: We compared the
G3L signal predicted by the SAMs to measurements in the overlap
of the Galaxy And Mass Assembly survey (GAMA), the Kilo-Degree
Survey (KiDS), and the VISTA Kilo-degree Infrared Galaxy survey
(VIKING) by splitting lens galaxies into two colour and five
stellar-mass samples. Using an improved G3L estimator, we
measured the three-point correlation of the matter distribution
with ``mixed lens pairs'' with galaxies from different samples,
and with ``unmixed lens pairs'' with galaxies from the same
sample. \textbackslash Results: Predictions by the H15 SAM for
the G3L signal agree with the observations for all colour-
selected samples and all but one stellar-mass-selected sample
with 95\% confidence. Deviations occur for lenses with stellar
masses below 9.5 h$^{-2}$ M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ at scales
below 0.2 h$^{-1}$ Mpc. Predictions by the L12 SAM for stellar-
mass selected samples and red galaxies are significantly higher
than observed, while the predicted signal for blue galaxy pairs
is too low. \textbackslash Conclusions: The L12 SAM predicts
more pairs of low stellar mass and red galaxies than the H15 SAM
and the observations, as well as fewer pairs of blue galaxies.
This difference increases towards the centre of the galaxies'
host halos. Likely explanations are different treatments of
environmental effects by the SAMs and different models of the
initial mass function. We conclude that G3L provides a stringent
test for models of galaxy formation and evolution.}},

 abstract = {{We present a tomographic cosmic shear analysis of the Kilo-Degree Survey
(KiDS) combined with the VISTA Kilo-Degree Infrared Galaxy
Survey. This is the first time that a full optical to near-
infrared data set has been used for a wide-field cosmological
weak lensing experiment. This unprecedented data, spanning 450
deg$^{2}$, allows us to significantly improve the estimation of
photometric redshifts, such that we are able to include robustly
higher-redshift sources for the lensing measurement, and - most
importantly - to solidify our knowledge of the redshift
distributions of the sources. Based on a flat
{\ensuremath{\Lambda}}CDM model we find S$_{8}$
{\ensuremath{\equiv}} {\ensuremath{\sigma}}$_{8}$
{\ensuremath{\Omega}}$_{m}$/0.3 = 0.737$^{+0.040}$$_{-0.036}$ in
a blind analysis from cosmic shear alone. The tension between
KiDS cosmic shear and the Planck-Legacy CMB measurements remains
in this systematically more robust analysis, with S$_{8}$
differing by 2.3{\ensuremath{\sigma}}. This result is
insensitive to changes in the priors on nuisance parameters for
intrinsic alignment, baryon feedback, and neutrino mass. KiDS
shear measurements are calibrated with a new, more realistic set
of image simulations and no significant B-modes are detected in
the survey, indicating that systematic errors are under control.
When calibrating our redshift distributions by assuming the
30-band COSMOS-2015 photometric redshifts are correct (following
the Dark Energy Survey and the Hyper Suprime-Cam Survey), we
find the tension with Planck is alleviated. The robust
determination of source redshift distributions remains one of
the most challenging aspects for future cosmic shear surveys.

gravitational lensing signal is measured. We present a framework
for calibrating shear with image simulations that demonstrates
the importance of including realistic correlations between
galaxy morphology, size, and more importantly, photometric
redshifts. This realism is essential to ensure that selection
and shape measurement biases can be calibrated accurately for a
tomographic cosmic shear analysis. We emulate Kilo-Degree Survey
(KiDS) observations of the COSMOS field using morphological
information from Hubble Space Telescope imaging, faithfully
reproducing the measured galaxy properties from KiDS
observations of the same field. We calibrate our shear
measurements from lensfit, and find through a range of
sensitivity tests that lensfit is robust and unbiased within the
allowed two per cent tolerance of our study. Our results show
that the calibration has to be performed by selecting the
tomographic samples in the simulations, consistent with the
actual cosmic shear analysis, because the joint distributions of
galaxy properties are found to vary with redshift. Ignoring this
redshift variation could result in misestimating the shear bias
by an amount that exceeds the allowed tolerance. To improve the
calibration for future cosmic shear analyses, it will also be
essential to correctly account for the measurement of
photometric redshifts, which requires simulating multi-band
observations.}},

 abstract = {{The outer regions of galaxies are more susceptible to the tidal
interactions that lead to intrinsic alignments of galaxies. The
resulting alignment signal may therefore depend on the passband
if the colours of galaxies vary spatially. To quantify this, we
measured the shapes of galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts
from the GAMA survey using deep gri imaging data from the
KiloDegree Survey. The performance of the moment-based shape
measurement algorithm DEIMOS was assessed using dedicated image
simulations, which showed that the ellipticities could be
determined with an accuracy better than 1\% in all bands.
Additional tests for potential systematic errors did not reveal
any issues. We measure a significant difference of the alignment
signal between the g, r and i-band observations. This difference
exceeds the amplitude of the linear alignment model on scales
below 2 Mpc h$^{-1}$. Separating the sample into
central/satellite and red/blue galaxies, we find that the
difference is dominated by red satellite galaxies.}},

 abstract = {{We present a public suite of weak-lensing mock data, extending the
Scinet Light Cone Simulations (SLICS) to simulate cross-
correlation analyses with different cosmological probes. These
mocks include Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS)-450- and LSST-like
lensing data, cosmic microwave background lensing maps and
simulated spectroscopic surveys that emulate the Galaxy And Mass
Assembly, BOSS, and 2-degree Field Lensing galaxy surveys. With
844 independent realizations, our mocks are optimized for
combined-probe covariance estimation, which we illustrate for
the case of a joint measurement involving cosmic shear, galaxy-
galaxy lensing, and galaxy clustering from KiDS-450 and BOSS
data. With their high spatial resolution, the SLICS are also
optimal for predicting the signal for novel lensing estimators,
for the validation of analysis pipelines, and for testing a
range of systematic effects such as the impact of neighbour-
exclusion bias on the measured tomographic cosmic shear signal.
For surveys like KiDS and Dark Energy Survey, where the
rejection of neighbouring galaxies occurs within
{\ensuremath{\sim}}2 arcsec, we show that the measured cosmic
shear signal will be biased low, but by less than a per cent on
the angular scales that are typically used in cosmic shear
analyses. The amplitude of the neighbour-exclusion bias doubles
in deeper, LSST-like data. The simulation products described in
this paper are made available at http://slics.roe.ac.uk/.}},

contrast to the deep r-band observations, which take priority
during excellent seeing conditions and form the primary KiDS

KiDS-i-800 spans a wide range of observing conditions. The
overlapping KiDS-i-800 and KiDS-r-450 imaging therefore provides
a unique opportunity to assess the robustness of weak lensing

The `nulled' two-point shear correlation function uses a matched
catalogue to show that the calibrated KiDS-i-800 and KiDS-r-450
shear measurements agree at the level of 1 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 4

 abstract = {{Weak gravitational lensing (WL) is one of the most powerful techniques
to learn about the dark sector of the universe. To extract the
WL signal from astronomical observations, galaxy shapes must be
measured and corrected for the point-spread function (PSF) of
the imaging system with extreme accuracy. Future WL
missions{\textemdash}such as NASA{\textquoteright}s Wide-Field
Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST){\textemdash}will use a family
of hybrid near-infrared complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor
detectors (HAWAII-4RG) that are untested for accurate WL
measurements. Like all image sensors, these devices are subject
to conversion gain nonlinearities (voltage response to collected
photo-charge) that bias the shape and size of bright objects
such as reference stars that are used in PSF determination. We
study this type of detector nonlinearity (NL) and show how to
derive requirements on it from WFIRST PSF size and ellipticity
requirements. We simulate the PSF optical profiles expected for
WFIRST and measure the fractional error in the PSF size
({\ensuremath{\Delta}}R/R) and the absolute error in the PSF
ellipticity ({\ensuremath{\Delta}}e) as a function of star
magnitude and the NL model. For our nominal NL model (a
quadratic correction), we find that, uncalibrated, NL can induce
an error of {\ensuremath{\Delta}}R/R = 1 {\texttimes} 10$^{-2}$
and {\ensuremath{\Delta}}e $_{2}$ = 1.75 {\texttimes} 10$^{-3}$
in the H158 bandpass for the brightest unsaturated stars in
WFIRST. In addition, our simulations show that to limit the bias
of {\ensuremath{\Delta}}R/R and {\ensuremath{\Delta}}e in the
H158 band to {\ensuremath{\sim}}10\% of the estimated WFIRST
error budget, the quadratic NL model parameter
{\ensuremath{\beta}} must be calibrated to
{\ensuremath{\sim}}1\% and {\ensuremath{\sim}}2.4\%,
respectively. We present a fitting formula that can be used to
estimate WFIRST detector NL requirements once a true PSF error
budget is established.}},

 abstract = {{Unlike optical CCDs, near-infrared detectors, which are based on CMOS
hybrid readout technology, typically suffer from electrical
crosstalk between the pixels. The interpixel capacitance (IPC)
responsible for the crosstalk affects the point-spread function
(PSF) of the telescope, increasing the size and modifying the
shape of all objects in the images while correlating the Poisson
noise. Upcoming weak lensing surveys that use these detectors,
such as WFIRST, place stringent requirements on the PSF size and
shape (and the level at which these are known), which in turn
must be translated into requirements on IPC. To facilitate this
process, we present a first study of the effect of IPC on WFIRST
PSF sizes and shapes. Realistic PSFs are forward-simulated from
physical principles for each WFIRST bandpass. We explore how the
PSF size and shape depends on the range of IPC coupling with
pixels that are connected along an edge or corner; for the
expected level of IPC in WFIRST, IPC increases the PSF sizes by
{\ensuremath{\sim}}5\%. We present a linear fitting formula that
describes the uncertainty in the PSF size or shape due to
uncertainty in the IPC, which could arise for example due to
unknown time evolution of IPC as the detectors age or due to
spatial variation of IPC across the detector. We also study of
the effect of a small anisotropy in the IPC, which further
modifies the PSF shapes. Our results are a first, critical step
in determining the hardware and characterization requirements
for the detectors used in the WFIRST survey.}},

These are then identified as particle-added eigenstates from the

study of random promoted two-particle states, and it is shown
that they may have large delocalisation such as generic random
states and scale exactly like them. However, the entanglement as

different even if localisation measures such as participation

 abstract = {{Upcoming weak lensing surveys will survey large cosmological volumes to
measure the growth of cosmological structure with time and
thereby constrain dark energy. One major systematic uncertainty
in this process is the calibration of the weak lensing shape
distortions, or shears. Most upcoming surveys plan to test
several aspects of their shear estimation algorithms using
sophisticated image simulations that include realistic galaxy
populations based on high-resolution data from the Hubble Space
Telescope (HST). However, existing data sets from the HST cover
very small cosmological volumes, so cosmic variance could cause
the galaxy populations in them to be atypical. A narrow redshift
slice from such surveys could be dominated by a single large
overdensity or underdensity. In that case, the morphology-
density relation could alter the local galaxy populations and
yield an incorrect calibration of shear estimates as a function
of redshift. We directly test this scenario using the COSMOS
survey, the largest-area HST survey to date, and show how the
statistical distributions of galaxy shapes and morphological
parameters (e.g. S{\'e}rsic n) are influenced by redshift-
dependent cosmic variance. The typical variation in rms
ellipticity due to environmental effects is 5 per cent
(absolute, not relative) for redshift bins of width
{\ensuremath{\Delta}}z = 0.05, which could result in uncertain
shear calibration at the 1 per cent level. We conclude that the
cosmic variance effects are large enough to exceed the
systematic error budget of future surveys, but can be mitigated
with careful choice of training data set and sufficiently large
redshift binning.}},
